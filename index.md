### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab three, part one, was a favorite because it is the assignment that sets the foundation for practical applications in our field. Price comparison is something I always think about to save money, and making this pizza unit price program taught me how to take advantage of this new-found knowledge and create programs that add intuitive solutions to the many problems of life. I could write an interactive program using std::cin and std::cout, as well as factoring in mathematical functions that gave the correct answer for the unit prices of each pizza. This lab also aided in understanding what the suitable data types were for each situation.

* Lab 4

    Lab four, part two, was also a favorite of mine as it broke into the possibilities of creating interactive games from scratch and was a multiplayer game of Hi-Lo. This lab was an introduction to the basics of implementation in game development and led me to hope to land a career in game design and development one day. This lab also taught me how to create an interactive program that utilizes if and else statements to complete a multi-turn game, keeping in mind the correct arithmetic operators to run the game fairly. It also further solidified my understanding of storing information into variables using std::cin, as these stored variables are called for the multiple turns in the game.

* Lab 7

    Lab seven, part two, was an exciting lab as it is true to how real blackjack is played compared to the first version, and I always wondered how it worked in digital versions of the game when there are so many variables to consider. This lab taught me how to utilize vectors in supplying and checking the number of cards in the program. Creating each and every type of card needed for blackjack and creating particular functions for aces were also needed compared to the first version of blackjack, as it can have a value of one or eleven depending on what is required.
